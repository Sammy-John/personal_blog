                        <h1>My Journey in Software Development: Year One - The Beginning</h1>
<h2 id="heading-0">Epigraph</h2>
<p>"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, theres no knowing where you might be swept off to" - J.R.R.Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring.</p><h2 id="heading-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Like Frodo stepping out of the shire, my own journey into software and development began with uncertainty and excitement. My quest was not through Middle-earth, but the vast, ever-changing landscape of technology. Though there were no dark lords or orc armies, I still faced formidable challenges. The languages of code sometimes felt as foriegn as Elvish, and time management was my own personal Balrog. Year one of my Bachelor of IT was filled with foundational lessons, and it set the stage for the adventures to come.</p><h2 id="heading-2">Starting as a Novice</h2>
<p>The catalyst for change and the beginning of my story began after the world was shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having spent nearly two decades in the hospitality industry, moving country and inability to work the seeds of doubt of a future in hospitality made me chart a new course. Long intrigued by Software Development and technology became my focus and like Frodo being handed the One ring, I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting into, but I knew I had to take the first step. This was signing upto a Diploma in Software Development.</p><h2 id="heading-3">Overview: Year One</h2>
<p>The first year felt like stepping out from the safety of home—everything was new and exciting. My initial classes in IT Systems and Professional Practice laid the groundwork for what was to come, introducing key concepts like computer functionality and personal effectiveness. Discovering tools such as Linux, Trello, Miro, and Git was like finding a ranger’s essential gear—vital for navigating this new world. One of my first assignments on future technologies sparked my interest in automation, a topic that has only grown more relevant with the rise of AI during my journey. I still laugh at the memory of submitting that assignment, only to realize too late that my spellchecker had turned every mention of "chatbots" into "catboats"! During this time, I also built my own PC—a milestone in itself—which has been invaluable to my progress, and as my skills have evolved my tools are ready to upgrade as well.</p><p>As I moved into Data Handling and Web Concepts, navigating the ancient languages of the digital world gaining knowledge of SQL, HTML and CSS. Programming Principles introduced me to Python- covering essential concepts like data types, functions, loops and containers. </p><p>The final part of year one involved Business Analysis and Solution Desgin and Client-Side Development. Learning to see the bigger picture-how different components of software development fit together. Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the basics of Planning and Analysis came easy to me from my years in business, writing and reading reports.</p><h2 id="heading-4">Challenges and Growth</h2>
<p>Looking back, the challenges of the first year weren’t insurmountable, but they were vital to my growth. While I didn’t fully grasp every concept at the time, each lesson was a step forward, even if it felt slow. I may not have realized it then, but the foundational knowledge I gained had taken root and would prove invaluable as I moved ahead, especially when faced with the more difficult challenges that lay ahead.</p><h2 id="heading-5">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Year One was just the beginning, and I felt like I was ready to leave the safety of the Shire. I had found a passion for what I was doing and was eager for the journey ahead, unaware that the path would soon grow darker and more difficult than I had imagined.</p><h2 id="heading-6">Epitaph</h2>
<p>"The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the road has gone, and I must follow if I can."<br>— J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring</p> <!-- Main blog post content -->
